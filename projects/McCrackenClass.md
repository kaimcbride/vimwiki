# TEN WEEK CLASS PROPOSAL 

This is a photography course in ten weeks custom designed for the needs of Communications Team photographers. 
The weeks have been split into modules that cover a range of technical components, formal
considerations in the composition of the frame, conceptual elements of adding meaning, narrative, and
drama to photographs, and strategies for covering a range of photographic situations.

The weekly presentations will include slideshows and lectures presenting relevant examples from 
the history of photography and analysis of recent work from photojournalists. 

The weekly schedule is broken up into two one hour sessions to be held on two separate days. 
Exact schedule to be determined by team needs and my availability. Days and times would need
to remain the same each week. 

Recordings: Each class will be recorded and available for review and for students that might 
miss a class due to a work conflict.
