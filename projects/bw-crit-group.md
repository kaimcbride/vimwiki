# BW CRIT GROUP IDEAS


## Why Critique / Feedback

- crit serves the work not the person who made the work
- what ideas are coming across?
- how can technical aspects be improved?
- inspire you to make the work even better
- see the work with fresh eyes
- feedback from an interested peer group
- is the work communicating what you had hoped
- not just for stroking your ego

## First Draft

Calling all B&W photographers and lovers of the monochromatic photograph!!! Announcing the new StrudelMediaLive B&W Practitioners' Meeting Group!!!
((Note: Replace with title of class)) This class gathers a group of your peers to meet every two weeks to present your work for feedback.
The group discussions will be lead by unabashed B&W enthusiast Kai McBride who will also give short presentations on topics designed to stimulate.
Are your photographs communicating what you had hoped? Are there technical aspects or conceptual ideas which could be improved? See your work
with fresh eyes as we look at it together. Not to worry, group critique is not a competitive process but rather a method for articulation that leads to 
greater understanding and mutual discovery. No assignments. Self-directed. Show photographs you just made and work that you have been fine tuning
for a while. Incorporate changes suggested during a previous meeting and show your progress. Everyone will be motivated knowing that there is an 
upcoming meeting where your fellow B&W photographers are there to urge you on. Join our B&W Appreciation Society and sign up for this class today.
