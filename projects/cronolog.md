# The New Cronolog

## Thoughts about the new journal configuration

- soft cover
    - Cloth? Cloth over a thin board or cardstock?
    - how does the title get put on the cloth? spray paint of a stencil?
    - 
- perfect bound after it is completed

- 100 sheets
- title ideas
    - The New Cronolog
    - 21st Century Cronolog
    - The Cronolog of Kai McBride
    - (what else other than cronos for days or months or years)
    - numbered by the NATO alphabet instead of roman numerals
        - Alfa, Beta, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Gamma, ...
    - Maybe title is "The Alfa Cronolog", "The Beta Cronolog", ...
- shouldn't have to number the pages before it is bound, but perhaps number as they get put into the completed box
- need to make an 'IN' and 'OUT' box or folder or system
    - maybe a staggered two box hanging file. Blank on top, completed underneath
    - simple cardboard or thin board with bungee/rubber to hold them halves together
    - two small cardboard boxes like photo boxes
- title page should definitely be typed or have typed elements
- last page can be like ST with:
    - address, phone, email
    - start and end date
    - my name
- consider having a rubber stamp made for these items that get filled out
