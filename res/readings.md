# READINGS ON PHOTOGRAPHY

Compiled for G. Shomo November 2023

## ILLUSTRATED 

- The Photographer's Eye
    - Anything by John Szarkowski is worth reading
- Looking at Photographs
    - Another great MoMA book
- The Nature of Photographs: a Primer
    - Stephen Shore
- Seeing Things
    - Joel Meyerowitz
    - aimed at kids, but well done and fun
 
## FEWER PHOTOS, MORE WORDS

- On Photography
    - Susan Sontag, natch. Not a huge fan of this, but it is seminal
- Regarding the Pain of Others
    - later S.S. response to O.P. I remember liking this more, maybe
- Why People Photograph 
    - R. Adams (and other books)
    - I'm a big fan of some of these essays
- The Complete Essays 1973-1991
    - Luigi Ghirri

## DENSE PHOTO NERDS ONLY

- Towards a Philosophy of Photography 
    - Vilem Flusser 
    - Like Sontag and Barthes, more about talking about their philosophy through the lens of photography
- Camera Lucida
    - Roland Barthes 
    - This one is given too much weight in my opinion
    - people get carried away with the 'punctum'
