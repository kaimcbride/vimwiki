Good rule of thumb is to oversize by 30% on the current. 
The MPPT will clip the current. Important, you aren't going over the PV Voltage to the MPPT, that will destroy the unit. 
So I could have up to 39Amps coming from the PV (as long as it was under 100V)* Optimum Angle for Panels


## Solar Panel Angles 

*Based on Santa Fe at 35.41N Lat and 105.56W Longitude*

*These angles are based on 0 degrees being flat on the ground (not 90)*

## Twice a Year Change

- March to August: 14 degrees
- September to February: 57 degrees

## Quarterly Change

- March to May: 26 degrees
- June to August: 14 degrees
- September to November: 44 degrees
- December to February: 57 degrees
